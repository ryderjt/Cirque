# Cirque â€” Cinematic Video Essay Collective

A minimalist, atmospheric marketing site for **Cirque**, a cinematic video essay collective exploring history, philosophy, and art. Built with Next.js 14, Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion, and Lenis to create smooth parallax motion, analogue-inspired textures, and slow cinematic reveals.
